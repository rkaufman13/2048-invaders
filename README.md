# 2048 invaders

2048 is a probably unwinnable game. Good luck.

## How to play

-Open the game's index.html in your browser.- Update 2023: CORS will no longer allow you to run this in your browser; use a library such as http-server within the home directory of the game to run it on localhost:8080. Use the arrow keys to move the ship left and right, and space to fire. Hit matching tiles to create larger powers of 2!
