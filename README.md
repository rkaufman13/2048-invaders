# 2048 invaders

2048 is a probably unwinnable game.  I made it to practice the lessons in the Codecademy Phaser course.

## How to play

-Open the game's index.html in your browser.- Update 2023: CORS will no longer allow you to run this in your browser; use a library such as http-server within the home directory of the game to run it on localhost:8080. Use the arrow keys to move the ship left and right, and space to fire. Hit matching tiles to create larger powers of 2!

## Authors and acknowledgment

The base Phaser code to render the game screen and move enemies is inspired by a Codecademy tutorial. The rest was coded by Rachel Kaufman with much wailing and gnashing of teeth.
