# 2048 invaders

2048 is a probably unwinnable game.  I made it to practice the lessons in the Codecademy Phaser course.

## How to play

Launch the game in your browser. Use the arrow keys to move the ship left and right, and space to fire. Hit matching tiles to create larger powers of 2!

## Authors and acknowledgment
The base Phaser code to render the game screen and place and move enemies comes straight from Codecademy. The rest was coded by Rachel Kaufman with much wailing and gnashing of teeth.
